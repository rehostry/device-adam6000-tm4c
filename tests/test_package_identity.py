"""Guard: the package this suite imports must be THIS repo's own ``src/``.

Not hypothetical. ``device-neuralert-release``'s suite imported
``rehostry_neuralert`` -- ``device-neuralert-da16200``'s package -- in four
places across two files. The sibling was installed and this repo's package was
not, so 30 tests passed while validating the *other* device's configs and
pinning the *other* device's ZMQ ports. Nothing in the suite could notice: a
green run measuring the wrong repo looks exactly like a green run.

It needs no shared package name. Any importable ``rehostry_*`` sibling will do,
and installs are per-venv, so which tree a name resolves to is a property of the
environment, not of this source tree -- which is precisely why it has to be
asserted at run time rather than reviewed once.
